# mobile_localization
In this study, the location of moving mobile phones with good estimation was investigated by using the cooperative method and Kalman filter. Also, due to GPS limitations, BTS is used. Due to the movement of mobile phones and the use of BTS, a number of BTSs are placed in NLOS, so by maximum density algorithm mitigate NLOS effect
